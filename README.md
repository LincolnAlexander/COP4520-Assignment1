## Welcome Non-Technical Manager!

To run my program you will need to open your command prompt and download files: MyClass.java
Navigate to the to the folder where you downloaded that file.
Compile the file by typing: javac MyClass.java
Execute the file by typing: java MyClass
You will then find all neccesary information in primes.txt

## Summary

I decided to use a popular algorithm for frinding primes called Sieve of Eratosthenes.
I used multhreading and gave specific ranges to 8 threads so threads weren't doing the same work as others.
This design makes the program as efficient as can be. I checked how many primes were in 10^8 and then made sure my final program got the same result.
