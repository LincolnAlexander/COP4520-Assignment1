I decided to use a popular algorithm for frinding primes called Sieve of Eratosthenes. 
I used multhreading and gave specific ranges to 8 threads so threads weren't doing the same work as others.
This design makes the program as efficient as can be. I checked how many primes were in 10^8 and then made sure my final program got the same result.
